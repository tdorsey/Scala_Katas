#### Note
There are several branches in this repository:
* ```master```: Implemented Triangle kata in Python
* ```develop```: Work performed on the triangle kata in python w/unit tests in pytest
# Triangles

Using TDD, write a method or function that accepts three numbers as the lengths of three line segments.
Determine computationally which of the following cases are true:

The three segments
  1. Can be joined into an equilateral triangle. (example: 3, 3, 3)
  1. Can be joined into an isosceles triangle. (example: 5, 5, 3);
  1. Can be joined into a right triangle. (example: 3, 4, 5);
  1. Can only be joined into a triangle that is not one of the preceding cases. (example: 2, 3, 4)
  1. Cannot be made into a triangle. (example: 2, 3, 5) [Warning: might look isosceles at first glance.]

The order in which the segments are supplied must not affect the result.
